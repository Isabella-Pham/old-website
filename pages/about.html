    <p>Hi there, I'm Isabella Pham and I've always wanted to be a computer scientist. It all began in fifth grade when I created my first website that was about Pokemon. From there I tried out so many different computer science things from programming a near-space satellite to coding robots, I really enjoy computer science! I'm currently looking for summer internships for new computer science experiences so if you think I am a good match for your company, feel free to contact me. </p>
